# Reflecting On The Use of AI During My Journey In ICS 314

## I. Introduction

### The Role of AI in Software Engineering Education
The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, particularly in software engineering, represents a paradigm shift in learning methodologies. In ICS 314, AI tools like ChatGPT, Bard, and Co-Pilot have emerged as significant assets. These tools, with their advanced capabilities, have offered unique perspectives in understanding complex concepts, enhancing coding practices, and simplifying problem-solving processes.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

### A. Experience WODs (E18)
In the Underscore.js functional programming WOD, I utilized ChatGPT to enhance my comprehension. It helped clarify complex concepts, making the learning process more efficient.

### B. In-class Practice WODs
ChatGPT was a resource for error checking, though I used it sparingly, mainly to understand and rectify coding mistakes.

### C. In-class WODs
When unclear about a task, I used ChatGPT to provide foundational code and functions. However, due to previous practice WODs, I could modify and adapt the AI-generated code to fit specific needs.

### D. Essays
ChatGPT played a significant role in essay writing, transforming basic bullet points and ideas into well-articulated text. It served as a tool to elevate the quality of my writing, even enabling me to achieve a Shakespearean flair, demonstrating its versatility in language usage. This portion was 100% made by ChatGPT.

### E. Final Project
For debugging, documenting code, and testing new prototypes, ChatGPT was invaluable. Its effectiveness, however, depended heavily on my understanding of what to ask and how to ask it.

### F. Learning a Concept/Tutorial
I use ChatGPT daily to grasp new concepts, making learning more interactive and accessible.

### G. Answering Questions in Class/Discord
ChatGPT helped me expand upon questions, aiding in formulating more comprehensive and insightful inquiries rather than directly providing answers.

### H. Asking/Answering a Smart-Question
I haven't used AI for this purpose yet but plan to utilize it for creating unbiased and neutral smart questions or answers.

### I. Coding Example
For understanding Underscore.js, I asked ChatGPT for examples, like using `.pluck`, which allowed me to experiment and understand the library more effectively.

### J. Explaining Code
AI was consistently used to explain code segments, aiding in my understanding and ability to articulate coding logic.

### K. Writing Code
I employed ChatGPT for prototyping and crafting routine code segments, saving time and effort.

### L. Documenting Code
After completing each function, I used ChatGPT to draft documentation, modifying it as necessary to ensure accuracy and relevance.

### M. Quality Assurance
For identifying and fixing issues, like ESLint errors, ChatGPT was a frequent go-to. It saved time and frustration in debugging and code refinement.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

The incorporation of AI in ICS 314 significantly influenced my learning. It facilitated quicker comprehension of new concepts and served as a reliable tool for initial problem-solving. However, it sometimes led to over-reliance, potentially hindering deeper learning and critical thinking skills.

## IV. Practical Applications

Outside ICS 314, AI's applications in real-world projects, like during the HACC, were evident. It accelerated development cycles and offered innovative solutions. However, its effectiveness varied, sometimes requiring substantial human intervention to tailor AI-generated solutions to specific project needs.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

A major challenge was the AI's occasional inaccuracies and generic responses. However, this presents an opportunity for further refinement of AI tools to better cater to specialized educational needs in software engineering.

## VI. Comparative Analysis

Comparing traditional teaching methods with AI-enhanced approaches, AI clearly offers greater engagement and immediate access to a wide range of information. However, traditional methods still excel in providing nuanced understanding and fostering critical thinking.

## VII. Future Considerations

The future role of AI in software engineering education seems promising, particularly in personalized learning and adaptive problem-solving. However, balancing AI use with traditional methodologies will be crucial to ensure comprehensive learning.

## VIII. Conclusion

The use of AI in ICS 314 has been a mixed bag of enhanced efficiency and occasional over-reliance. Optimizing AI integration in future courses requires a balanced approach, leveraging AI's strengths while acknowledging its limitations. The key lies in using AI as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, traditional learning methods.
